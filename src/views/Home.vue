        <p><strong>Robin Robinson</strong></p>

        <p>Robin Robinson is an award winning journalist and respected broadcaster whose more than three decades of Chicago-based reporting is marked by in depth coverage of social justice issues, politics, significant people and events. Her trademark is tackling complex issues that matter, and including the voices of the people they matter to.  While covering all of the big stories, from sports championships to presidential inaugurations, Robinson’s passion is enlightening audiences with new perspectives and unique content.</p>

        <p>In June of 2016, Robinson’s activism in social justice, restorative practices and neighborhood revitalization led to her current role with the Chicago Police Department as Director of Community Affairs. </p>

        <p>Robinson has also enjoyed “playing” a reporter on episodes of several television series, including Prison Break (Fox), Chicago Code (Fox), Crisis (NBC), Empire (Fox), Chicago Fire (NBC) and motion pictures Contagion (2011, Warner Brothers) and Office Christmas Party (December 2016, DreamWorks Studios)</p>

        <p>A native Chicagoan, Robinson spent her younger years in California where she earned her Bachelors Degree in Journalism at San Diego State University and began her broadcast news career at KGTV in San Diego.

        <p>On her new position with the Chicago Police Department, Robinson says it is “the most important work I have ever done … we are at a crucial crossroad in American justice, with an opportunity to turn from the harmful interactions of the past and engage in authentic reconciliation that transforms the problematic relationship among law enforcement and communities of color, restoring hope for true partnership and the co-creation of a path to a safer, more peaceful future.”</p>
